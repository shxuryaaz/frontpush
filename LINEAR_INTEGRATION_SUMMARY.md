## API Integration

### Backend Endpoint
The frontend now sends requests to the multi-platform endpoint:
- **Endpoint:** `POST /send-audio`
- **Platform Parameter:** Added `platform` field to identify the target platform

### Form Data Structure

**For Trello:**
```javascript
{
  audio: Blob,
  platform: "trello",
  apiKey: "trello_api_key",
  token: "trello_token", 
  boardId: "trello_board_id"
}
```

**For Linear:**
```javascript
{
  audio: Blob,
  platform: "linear",
  apiKey: "linear_api_key",
  workspaceId: "linear_workspace_id"
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Platform Selection
- Clear dropdown with platform logos
- Linear option added alongside Trello and Notion
- Custom Linear branding with purple color scheme

### 2. Configuration Form
- Dynamic fields based on platform selection
- Platform-specific help text and instructions
- Links to official documentation
- Clear validation messages

### 3. Help Documentation
**Trello Instructions:**
- API Key: Link to trello.com/app-key
- Token: Instructions for generation
- Board ID: URL location guidance

**Linear Instructions:**
- API Key: Settings → API → Personal API Keys
- Workspace ID: URL or workspace settings location
- Link to Linear API documentation

### 4. Cookie Management
- Platform-specific cookie storage
- Backward compatibility with existing Trello users
- Automatic platform detection on app load
